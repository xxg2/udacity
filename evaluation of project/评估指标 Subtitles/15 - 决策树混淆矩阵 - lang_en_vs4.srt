00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:03,880
So here I'm drawing what could be the result of decision tree learning.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,610
Where again red is my positive class and green's my negative class, and

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,800
then giving you a whole bunch of data points.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,660
And in the mere counting exercise I want you just fill in the confusion matrix.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,500
Once again we have a actual class and a predicted class.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,570
The actual is on top.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,310
The predicted on the left.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,610
And we have once again the four different cases.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,480
So take a look at the right side and do your counts.
