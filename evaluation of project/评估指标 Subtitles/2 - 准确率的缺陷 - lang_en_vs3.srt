1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,360
So here's a quiz for you.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:07,170
Although accuracy is a perfectly fine metric and a good place to start,

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,580
it does have some shortcomings, so let's think about what those might be

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,665
in the case where we want to identify persons of interest in the Enron data set.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,830
So here are a few possible shortcomings.

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,980
And you check all of the ones that sound like they could be problems in

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,050
our case.

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,490
The first possible problem is that maybe accuracy is not ideal for

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,300
skewed classes.

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,220
So skewed class would be an example of where you have many data points and

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,140
a few of them fall into one class and many of them fall into the other class.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,960
This is what's going on with the Enron data set because, although there were

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,330
thousands of people who worked at Enron, there were only a few dozen who ended

14
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,190
up really being pursued by the law for their involvement in, in the fraud.

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,340
So accuracy might not be an ideal metric in that particular case where you

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,380
have very few examples of, of one of the classes.

17
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,680
Another possibility is that maybe, depending on exactly what you mean by

18
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,680
identifying a person of interest, you might want to err on

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,710
the side of guessing that someone is innocent when you're in doubt.

20
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:09,000
That if, for example, as a result of this, that maybe you're you're machine

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,680
learning algorithm is identifying people who should be thrown in jail.

22
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,370
In that case, I would say you want to be really sure that someone is involved in

23
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,690
the fraud before you risk putting them in jail for a long time.

24
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,080
And that if you have any doubt at all,

25
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,405
you should err on the side of assuming that they're innocent.

26
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:28,100
That accuracy perhaps might not be particularly tailored to

27
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,050
that outcome that you want.

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,110
And a third possibility might be that accuracy isn't well tailored to

29
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,310
the outcome that you want but in the other direction.

30
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,250
Let's suppose that you want kind of a broad net being cast.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,170
That all the people who are identified as persons of interest just means that

32
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,300
they're going to get a little bit of a higher level of scrutiny.

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,960
And that there might be still lots of investigation going on.

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,620
And so in that case, what you would want to do is make sure that you get

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,660
as many people who were actually involved in the fraud as possible identified.

36
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,430
Even if it comes to the cost of identifying some people who were

37
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,402
probably innocent.

38
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:06,080
Because those innocent people will then be investigated and cleared in later

39
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,680
rounds of the investigation, and that accuracy might not be the right metric if

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,380
that's the goal that you're going for in trying to identify persons of interest.

41
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,000
So check any of these boxes that you think could be a little bit of a problem if

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,140
all you're doing is trying to maximize the accuracy of your classifier.
