1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,360
So let's now define the confusion matrix.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,750
I added a few data points on the right side here.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,510
Now I want you to count the number of points that fall into each of

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,220
the four quadrants of the confusion matrix.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,390
So count on the right and put the numbers on the left
