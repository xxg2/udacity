00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,010
So here's my final question which will be challenging.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,250
I'm going to redefine precision as a quotient where up here we

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:07,950
have the number of true positives.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,550
And down here we have the addition of Which ones on

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,220
the left side go into the denominator on the right side?

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,340
Think carefully, and

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,310
click on the corresponding items on the left side that go right over here
