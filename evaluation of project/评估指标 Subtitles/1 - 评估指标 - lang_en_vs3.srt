Welcome to the lesson on evaluation metrics.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,660
Evaluation metrics are how you can tell if your machine learning algorithm is

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,360
getting better and how well you're doing overall.

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,620
&gt;&gt; And we are at my favorite place in the entire company,

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,470
which is the foosball table where I get to evaluate it myself,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,300
pretty much every day by applying or playing my colleagues and see how I score.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,980
&gt;&gt; And people like me who aren't quite as good at foosball might not

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,330
use wins and losses as our evaluation metrics, but maybe, I would say

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,330
something like how many goals do I score overall or how long does the game last?

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,417
&gt;&gt; In machine learning, it's really important that you know your evaluation and

11
00:00:30,417 --> 00:00:33,151
understand how to apply your evaluation to measure the right result.

12
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:35,832
&gt;&gt; And that's what we'll be talking about in this class, so shall we?

13
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:36,557
&gt;&gt; Let's play a game.

14
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:38,800
&gt;&gt; All right.
