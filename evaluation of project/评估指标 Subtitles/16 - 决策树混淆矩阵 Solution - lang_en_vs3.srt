1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,700
The main diagonal is easy.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,070
It's green counted correctly.

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:08,260
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

4
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,510
For white, I get a total of eight, and then the number of,

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:16,420
and then the misclassified ones are these three data points over

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,980
here that I'm circling in blue.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,090
This is a true negative classified as positive, and it goes over here.

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,330
It's truly negative but

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,400
predicted as positive, and these guys over here are just the opposite.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,000
They go there. So

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,001
next, you're going to do a seven by seven confusion matrix from what?

12
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:35,260
&gt;&gt; From the PCA lesson.

13
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,434
The item faces.

14
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:37,820
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm handing it over to Katie.
