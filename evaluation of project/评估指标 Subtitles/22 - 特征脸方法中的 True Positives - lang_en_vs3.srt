00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:02,916
So just to make life a little more complicated,

2
00:00:02,916 --> 00:00:06,683
let's recall that we talked about things like true positives.

3
00:00:06,683 --> 00:00:09,955
False positives and false negatives.

4
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:12,925
Notice I left out true negatives because Kate and

5
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:16,225
I couldn't quite agree what it would mean in this example.

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:19,744
But we can generalize that these, these three words, these three expressions to

7
00:00:19,744 --> 00:00:22,805
a confusion matrix with more than two concepts positive and negative.

8
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:26,769
We have seven different concepts, as in this example over here.

9
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,400
Tell me for the concept, Tony Blair.

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,040
What you think is the number of true positives
