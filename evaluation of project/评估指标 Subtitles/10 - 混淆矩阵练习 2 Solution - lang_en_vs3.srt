1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,150
And this data point is truly positive.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,230
It's a red cross, but it's predicted to be negative.

3
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,290
So truly actual positive was predicted negative falls over

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:10,930
here and not over there.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,770
I hope you got that right.
