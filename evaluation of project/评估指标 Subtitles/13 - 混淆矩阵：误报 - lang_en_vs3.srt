00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,660
So I have one final question here.

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,939
Suppose this is an alarm system and true means or

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,740
positive means there's a burglar in your house.

4
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:11,032
What box, what type of events and

5
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:16,260
these would you think best characterizes a false alarm of the alarm system?

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,590
So click on those four boxes and tell me which ones are false alarms
