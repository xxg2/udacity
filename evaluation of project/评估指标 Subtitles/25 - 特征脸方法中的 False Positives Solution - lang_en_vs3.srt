1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,310
The number here is 8,

2
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:06,570
which is the sum of all the observations of Tony Blair that were actually false.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,109
That's what's called a false positive.

4
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,130
We think it's positive, but it actually is not.
