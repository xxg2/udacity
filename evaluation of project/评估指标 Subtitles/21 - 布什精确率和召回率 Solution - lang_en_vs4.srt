00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,440
The recall, the cases when it's truly Bush, and

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:08,680
we recognize it's Bush, is 123 over 127, which resolves to about .97, 97%.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:12,920
Where as the precision for George W.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,860
Bush, that's this column over here.

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,480
In my calculations 123 over 156,

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,700
which is the sum of all the predictions of George W.

7
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,440
Bush. And that resolves to about 0.79.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,230
Much lower.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,470
Whether this warrants a recall for George W.

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,700
Bush, is an open question, but you can see the asymmetry.

11
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,130
This specific learning algorithm is really good in recalling or

12
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,920
finding George W.

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,630
Bush, provided that it's actually Bush in the image.

14
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:40,990
But it mistakes many, many other people.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,170
Most notably Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld for George W.

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:44,670
Bush.
