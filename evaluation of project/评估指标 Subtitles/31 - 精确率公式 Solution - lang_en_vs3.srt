1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,660
And this one's tricky.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,020
Let's take Hugo Chavez again,

3
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:06,310
where we knew that the precision was 10, number of true positives,

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,360
divided by all the numbers in this vertical column over here, all zeros.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,410
We knew the precision was one.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,585
And the numbers in the vertical column, except for

7
00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:20,170
10, recall those false positives.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,320
So the correct answer here, is we take the true positives and

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,780
the false positives, add them up, and those become the,

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,180
and, and those become the denominator of this equation over here.

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,850
So, it's going to be the true positives,

12
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:38,392
plus the false positives that fall into the denominator over here
