00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,830
So I'm going to talk about confusion matrices.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,311
It's a word you've probably never heard before, but it's good vocabulary if you

3
00:00:06,311 --> 00:00:09,160
want to do machine learning and talk to somebody else about it.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,120
Imagine we have a classifier above this line,

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,680
the class tables are red Xs, and below the line we have green circles.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,393
As before, we call the red X as positive examples and

7
00:00:19,393 --> 00:00:21,250
the green circle's negative.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,030
The confusion matrix is a two by two matrix.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:27,918
It compares the actual class, which can be positive or negative.

10
00:00:27,918 --> 00:00:30,540
With it, we called a predicted class,

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,520
it's our output which also can be positive or negative.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,400
And each on the right increments the count on the left.

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,160
So let's see.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,670
Let's take a data point over here that is negative, and

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:47,190
that is classified to lie on the green side of the classifier.

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,410
If I wanted to count this type of data,

17
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,000
in which of the four buckets on the left would it fall?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,605
Just click on the corresponding pocket.
