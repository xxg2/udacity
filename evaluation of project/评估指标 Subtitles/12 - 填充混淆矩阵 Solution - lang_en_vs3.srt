1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:05,240
My answers would be, there are 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 positive positives.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,800
8 over here.

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,710
Number of positives, actual positives that I misclassified as negative are 3, so

4
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,760
the guys over here.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,340
And only one truly negative is misclassified as positive.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,860
So that's the confusion matrix.
