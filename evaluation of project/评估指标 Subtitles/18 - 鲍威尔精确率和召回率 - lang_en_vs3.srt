1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,860
So let's apply the recall and precision concept to a different name.

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,430
Let's take Colin Powell.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,100
Can you, from this matrix, compute the recall rate and

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,170
the precision rate for Colin Powell?
