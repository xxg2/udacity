1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,480
And I would say that all of these are concerns that you should have when you're

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,510
thinking about the metric that you should pick.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,800
And they do all happen to be problems with accuracy in the,

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,340
in the case of identifying persons of interest.

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,380
So, accuracy can give you a problem when you have skewed

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,750
classes because the denominator of this formula, all the items in this class,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,560
ends up being a very small number, which means the accuracy that you compute as

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,330
a result is something that you might not be sort of as, as trustworthy of as if

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,050
you have lots and lots of examples of, of instances of that class.

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,180
Also, the second two options are going to be things you want to think about,

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,260
that you want to pick an, a metric that's really tailored to the operation

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,540
that you're trying to do, and that, as a result, you might want to maximize

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,170
the chance that you err on the side of guessing that someone's innocent.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,860
Or that conversely,

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,860
you err on the side of flagging them as a person of interest even if it

16
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,570
means that you catch more innocent people sort of in your net as a result.

17
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,480
Accuracy is not particularly well-suited to either of these outcomes, but

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,820
there are some evaluation metrics that are, and

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,830
that will be what we talk about in this lesson.
