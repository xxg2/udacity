00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:02,410
Now that you've had your refresher on accuracy,

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,689
which of course you're well familiar with from earlier in this class.

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,500
We're going to talk about some other evaluation metrics that might be a little

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,380
bit more specific depending on what you want to be doing with your machine

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,800
learning algorithm.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,820
&gt;&gt; In many cases in real life you care about certain outcomes more than others.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,770
We have an Asymmetry.

8
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,070
For example, if you write a cancer detection test.

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,000
I would argue care more about that the cancer gets detected.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,350
Even if you tolerate, occasionally,

11
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:30,390
false detection, than overlooking cancer which could be disastrous for you.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,760
That's a case where your performance metric favors one type

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,880
of error differently from another type of error.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,800
&gt;&gt; So depending on the metric you use it can help you really zero in on

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,900
what types of mistakes you might be making.

16
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,550
And you can tune your algorithm for

17
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,270
exactly what you want it to be optimized for.

18
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,130
&gt;&gt; And it's really important you know about this and

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,520
apply it because otherwise you might not like your results.
