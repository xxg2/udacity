00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,310
I say the false alarm is one where your alarm goes off, so positive for

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,939
burglary, but there isn't a burglary.

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:11,090
So in the true world the event is negative, but your system says positive.

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,490
So this is where the check mark should go and you can see a bit of an asymmetry.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,230
You can see that you might care about negative events that give you

6
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,000
a positive alarm differently from positive events that are being missed.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,900
And just to give you kind of a little bit of look ahead,

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,250
often by changing parameters you can move this curve in either direction.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,320
And if you believe that a false alarm, which is the police come to

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,090
your house checking for burglary, is a different price point from a missed event

11
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,800
like someone robbing you of all your belongings without police even noticing,

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,800
then you might want to reshift this line up and down.
