00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,410
So, let me tell you about two technical terms.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,740
One called recall, one is called precision.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:08,560
These are the terms for what you just computed.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,530
For example, the recall rate on Hugo Chavez is the quotient of how many,

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:18,830
is the probability of our algorithm to correctly identify Hugo Chavez,

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,860
provided that the person actually is Hugo Chavez.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,740
So in our case, it was 10 over 16.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,170
Precision of the same concept would be the rate of which the rate of

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,870
which if our algorithm predicted would be the second rate that we studied,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,200
which happened to be one.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,999
It's the quotient of, suppose our algorithm observes that there's Hugo Chavez,

12
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:39,459
what are the chances that it actually is Hugo Chavez and

13
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:40,974
it happened to be 10 over 10?
