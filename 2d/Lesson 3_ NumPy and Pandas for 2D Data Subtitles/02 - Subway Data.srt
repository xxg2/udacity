00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,180
Just like last lesson, you'll be
able to complete all the programming

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,000
exercises for
this lesson on the Udacity website.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,910
But the data is available in the
downloadable section in case you'd like

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,410
to explore it further.

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,330
Again, I'll be focusing on NumPy and

6
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,010
Panda's rather than going through
the data analysis process in order.

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,139
But I still want you to
start by asking questions.

8
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:22,490
So download the description of the data
from the downloadable section,

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,320
then think of at least five questions
you could answer with this data and

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,890
share them on the forums.

11
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:28,630
When you're finished, check these boxes.
