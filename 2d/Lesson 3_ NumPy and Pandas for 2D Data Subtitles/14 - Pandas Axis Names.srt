00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:04,660
Just like NumPy, many Panda's
functions also take an axis argument.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,050
And you can use axis = 0 or
axis = 1, like for NumPy,

3
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:14,000
but you can also use axis = index or
axis = columns.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,250
Now this sounds like it should make
it easier to remember which version

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,300
of the axis argument is which, but
it can actually be pretty confusing.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,320
Taking the mean with axis equals
columns will actually not

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,910
give the mean of each column.

8
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,490
Instead it gives the mean of each row.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,710
The idea is that you are taking
the mean along the columns.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,850
Similarly with axis = index, you
are taking the mean along the index, or

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:39,410
the rows.

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,930
I still have trouble remembering which
way the axis argument will work, so

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,220
again I always try it out in iPython and

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,060
see what happens before
I use the argument.
