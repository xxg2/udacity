00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,530
To write the convert_grades function
I'll first write a function that

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,000
converts a single grade, and

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,220
then I can apply that function
to the entire data frame.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,620
I'll call the singular version
of the function convert_grade.

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,280
I wrote this function using
a series of if statements.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,580
First, if the grade was at
least 90 then I returned A,

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,480
then if the grade was at least
80 I returned B and so on.

8
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,470
Now I'll try this function
out on a few single values.

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,470
If I convert the grade 80, I get B.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,180
And if I convert 79, I get C,
which is what I expected.

11
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,870
Next I can use the applymap function

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,270
to call the convert_grade function
on each element of the data frame.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,250
Now I'll call this function on
the example grid's data frame and

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,130
it looks like it worked.
