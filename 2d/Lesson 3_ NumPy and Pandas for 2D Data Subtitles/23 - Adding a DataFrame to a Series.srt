1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,449
You saw before that you could use
vectorized operations to add two

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:06,835
DataFrames together, just like
you can add two series together.

3
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:10,930
It's also possible in pandas to
add a DataFrame to a series.

4
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,800
What do you think this will do?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,309
On the next screen, try it out and see
if you can figure out what is happening.

6
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,720
Once you think you know how it works,

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,650
watch the solution video
to see if you were right.
