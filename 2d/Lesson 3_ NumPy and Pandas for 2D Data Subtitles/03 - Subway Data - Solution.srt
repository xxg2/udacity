00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,690
Here are some questions I thought of.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:06,000
In general, I'm interested in what
variables are related to higher or

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,820
lower subway ridership.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,930
If I were working for
the New York Subway,

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,580
this information might be useful when
scheduling how many trains to run.

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,040
But since I don't I'm just curious.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,480
There are several variables that
could be related to subway ridership.

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,250
For example,

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,670
which stations have the most riders and
how dramatic is the difference?

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,940
I'd also like to know what are the
ridership patterns like over time?

11
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,090
Will I be able to see rush hour effects?

12
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,189
How will weekdays and weekends differ?

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:35,830
This data includes the month of May,
which includes Memorial Day, so

14
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,710
I wonder whether Memorial Day ridership
will be similar to weekend days?

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,600
I could also look at how the weather
affects subway ridership.

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,350
Do more or fewer people ride
the subway when it's raining,

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,510
when it's hotter out, etc.

18
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,580
I could also investigate weather
patterns in New York independently of

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,050
the subway.

20
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,520
For example,
since May comes before the summer,

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,630
is the weather systematically getting
hotter and hotter throughout the month?

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,220
And how does the weather
vary across the city?

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,790
Hopefully your excited to
answer some of these questions.

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,410
Lets get started.
