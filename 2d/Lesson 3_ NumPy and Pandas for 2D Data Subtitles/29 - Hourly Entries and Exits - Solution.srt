1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,220
I'll use the function I wrote earlier
as a starting point since that will be

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,950
the code to calculate the hourly
entries and exits for a single group.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,330
This time I've named
the functionhourly_for_group.

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,750
Now the first thing I'll need to do
is group the ridership_df by unit.

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,090
As usual this gives
the DataFrameGroupBy object.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,660
Now it might seem logical to apply the
hourly_for_group function at this point.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,980
However, if I try this I get
a message that says type error.

8
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,500
Unsupported operated types for minus.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,330
String and string.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,680
The reason this is happening is pandas
is trying to apply the hourly for

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,240
group function to each column of
the data frame, including the unit and

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,840
time columns.

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,080
Since these columns contain strings,
the function doesn't work on them.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,500
You can't subtract
a string from a string.

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,210
To fix this,
I need to select just the entries and

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,540
exits columns,
before applying this function.

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,950
Once I've done that,
the function works as expected.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,310
This time, I see two rows of NaNs,
one for each station.

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,570
That's because for
each station there was one row,

20
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,640
where there was no previous
row to compare it to.
