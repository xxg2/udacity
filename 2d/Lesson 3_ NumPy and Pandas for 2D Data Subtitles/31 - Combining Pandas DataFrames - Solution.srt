1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,130
I’ll start out by taking a look at the
first three rows of the two data frames

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,530
I want to merge.

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,980
The first thing I'll need to decide
is what to pass to the on keyword,

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,930
that is how to match up rows from
the two different data frames.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,540
It looks to me like I’ll want
to match up by date and hour,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,120
latitude and longitude.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,060
And so I'll call subway_df.merge,
weather_df.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,510
And then the on keyword will be
a list of those four fields.

9
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,360
I'll also need to decide whether how
should be inner, outer, left, or right,

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,830
and I've chosen inner, since I only want
rows that are present in both tables.

11
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,910
The result is a data frame with
all the columns from both tables.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,380
For example, the entries and exits
columns are from the subway data, and

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,340
the fog and pressure columns
are from the weather data.

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,040
They've been matched up by date,
hour, latitude and longitude.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,880
Now one thing that was convenient here
is that the four columns I wanted to

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,600
merge on have the same
name in both data frames.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,890
What would I do if
that weren't the case?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,070
For example, what would I do if
the date column were called DATEn

19
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,490
in the subway data and lowercase
date with no n in the weather data?

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,740
Because of this, Pandas allows
you to specify the left_on,

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,740
meaning the columns for the left table
and the right on meaning the columns for

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,950
the right table separately.

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,060
For the left on,
the columns will be the same as before.

24
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,210
And for the right on, the columns will
be the same but with the other name for

25
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,730
the date column.

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,860
And this code should give
the same results as before.
