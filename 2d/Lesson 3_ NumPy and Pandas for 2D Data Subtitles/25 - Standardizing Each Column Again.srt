00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,060
Earlier this lesson you wrote code
to standardize each column of

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,330
the data frame using apply.

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,350
Now using what you just learned,
I want to try the same thing again, but

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:10,110
this time without using apply.

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,990
Instead, use rectorized operations.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,720
As an extra challenge, try standardizing
each row of the data frame instead.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,640
Again, without using apply.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,860
This one is tricky.

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,260
You might have to experiment for
a while to get it to work.
