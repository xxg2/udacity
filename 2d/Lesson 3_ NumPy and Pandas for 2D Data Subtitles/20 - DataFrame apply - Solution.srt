00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,150
In order to write
the standardized function,

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:05,689
I'm first going to write a function that
standardizes one column of a DataFrame,

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:07,990
which I can then call on each
column of the DataFrame.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,160
I'll call the function that works on
a single column, standardized_column.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,660
And hopefully, the code in this
function looks familiar by now.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,180
I'll test this function by calling it on
a single column of the grades DataFrame.

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,630
And it looks good to me.

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:27,010
Then to standardize each column of
the data frame, I'll call df.apply and

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:28,970
pass in the standardized
column function.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,300
When I try this out, I can see that
I got the same results as before for

11
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,780
the first column, and

12
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,240
the results for the second
column have also been computed.
