1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,980
First, I want to find the mean ridership
per day for each subway station.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,990
Since each station is a column,

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,820
I can do this using the mean
function with an axis of 0.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,960
Sure enough, that gave me five means.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,510
One for each of the subway
stations in this array.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,250
I'll call this array station riders
since it contains the ridership for

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,790
each station.

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,120
Next, I need to find both the maximum
daily ridership and the minimum.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,990
I can find the maximum by
taking station_riders.max and

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,400
the minimum by taking
station_riders.min.

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,870
Next I'll move this code inside
of my function, and again,

12
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,620
I don't need to change
any variable names.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,220
And I'll return the max_daily_ridership,
and the min_daily_ridership.

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,720
Finally I'll run this function
on the example array.

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,840
It looks like the station with
the maximum riders per day had about

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,760
3200 and the station with
the minimum had about 1,000.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,200
The maximum is the same value that we
saw last time as the mean ridership for

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,690
the station with the maximum
on the first day.

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,080
Which indicates that the station in
this case that had the most riders on

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,050
the first day also had
the most riders overall.

21
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,460
The minimum is lower than the overall
mean we saw before, which makes sense.
