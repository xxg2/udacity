00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,900
Just like for a pandas series,
you sometimes might want to perform some

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:07,280
computation on a DataFrame that can't
be done using built-in functions or

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,880
operations.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,860
Similarly to a series,
you can write a function, let's say f,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,140
that takes in a single element from
the DataFrame and returns a new element.

6
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,720
Then you can apply
that function f to each

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,175
element of the original DataFrame
in order to get a new DataFrame.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,650
For example, last lesson,
I wrote a function called clean_state

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,780
to take in a state that might
be in one format or another, and

10
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,180
return it in a standardized format.

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,240
To call this function on each
element of the DataFrame df,

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,940
you would call df.applymap(clean_state).

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,750
Now, why is this
function called applymap

14
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,420
instead of apply like it was for series?

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,090
I think it's kind of unfortunate, but
you'll see in the next video that apply

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,080
does something slightly different for
DataFrames.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,870
In the next exercise, I want you
to write a function that converts

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,260
numerical grades to letter grades.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,360
You'll be given a DataFrame
where each column is an exam,

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,460
each row is a student and each value is
the score that student got on that exam.

21
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,272
You should use the rule that
a score of 90 or higher is an A,

22
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:13,322
80 or higher is a B, and so on.

23
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:15,456
Use applymap to create a new DataFrame,

24
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:18,860
where each numerical score has
been replaced by a letter grade.
