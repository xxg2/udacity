00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,530
I decided to make a plot of subway
ridership by day of the week.

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,980
The first thing I wanted to do
was take a look at the data and

3
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,490
remind myself where that
information was stored.

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,050
And I can see here that it's
in the day_week column.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,590
So the first thing I'm going to
do is group the subway data by

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,170
the day of the week.

7
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,470
And as before, this gives me
a data frame grouped by object so

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,860
I can't really see what's going on yet.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,960
Next, I want to take the mean
ridership for each day of the week, so

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,570
I'll add .mean.

11
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,240
This time, I can see some results.

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,590
This is showing me the mean value of
each column for each day of the week.

13
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm specifically interested in
the ENTRIESn_hourly column, so

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,860
I'll look at that one.

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,650
And then running this again, I see
a series containing only the values for

16
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,760
the ENTRIESn_hourly column.

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,930
And I'll name this
series ridership_by_day.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,400
Next I'm ready to make
a plot of these values.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,330
As usual I'll use %pylab inline to
make sure the plots appear within

20
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:57,350
the notebook and import seaborn as sns
to make my plots look a little nicer.

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,724
Next, I'll call ridership_by_day.plot.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,010
And this is the plot I get.

23
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,080
The most striking I notice is that
the ridership is significantly

24
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,800
lower on days 5 and
6 than during the rest of the week.

25
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,180
Days 5 and 6 are Saturday and
Sunday, so this makes sense.
