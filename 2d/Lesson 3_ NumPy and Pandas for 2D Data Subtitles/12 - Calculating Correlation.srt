00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,240
In the following quiz, I'd like you to
write a function to calculate what's

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,440
called the correlation of two variables.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,830
It's also known as Pearson's r.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,820
In the previous lesson,

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,320
you used a rough heuristic to determine
how correlated two variables were.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,910
For each pair of values, you looked
at whether both values were above

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,270
their respective means, both below,
or one above and one below.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,670
The idea behind Pearson's r is similar.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,680
First, you standardize each variable.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,700
That is, convert it to a number
of standard deviations above or

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,360
below the mean.

12
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,270
Then, you multiply each pair of values
and take the average of the products.

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,930
So, r is equal to the average
of x in standard units,

14
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,210
times y in standard units.

15
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:43,090
Let's take a look at what this is doing.

16
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,730
First, by standardizing,

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,430
we're converting both
variables to a similar scale.

18
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,060
So for example, if the variables were
much more spread out in the y dimension

19
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,200
than in the x dimension,

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,710
then standardizing would spread the
variables out more in the x dimension.

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,990
Next, since the mean is
subtracted from each data point,

22
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,700
the area is essentially
divided into four quadrants.

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,770
Where both values are above the mean,
both values are below the mean, or

24
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,910
one value is above the mean and
the other is below.

25
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,360
If both values are above the mean,
then the standardized x value and

26
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,960
y value will both be positive, so
the product will be positive as well.

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,370
If both values are below the mean,
then the standardized x and

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,900
y coordinates will both be negative.

29
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,890
So again the product will be positive.

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,670
Thus is Pearson's r is positive,

31
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,390
then as one variable increases
the other tends to increase as well.

32
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,660
On the other hand,
if one value is below the mean, and

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,460
the other value is above the mean,
then the product will be negative.

34
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,740
So if Pearson's r is negative,
that means as one variable increases,

35
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,970
the other tends to decrease.

36
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,020
Pearson's r is more accurate than
the heuristic you used earlier,

37
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,990
since it takes into account more
information than just which quadrant

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,030
each data point lies in.

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,180
For example, this data point is very
close to the mean of the y values, so

40
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,050
the contribution to
Pearson's r will be small.

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,210
On the other hand, this data point
is very far from each of the means.

42
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,220
So the contribution to
Pearson's r will be large.

43
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,726
Pearson's r can range from -1 to +1.

44
00:02:08,726 --> 00:02:12,940
If it is near zero, that means the
variables are not strongly correlated.

45
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,560
There's a link in the instructor
notes to a page with graphs for

46
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,260
different values of Pearson's r.

47
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,350
So that you can get a feel for

48
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,760
what different values of Pearson's
r look like in a scatter plot.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,280
In the next exercise you're going to
write a function to compute Pearson's r.

50
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,870
Then you can use it to check some
different variables from the New York

51
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,770
subway data set, and
see how correlated they are.

52
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,125
When standardizing both x and y,
you'll need to pass the argument

53
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:39,940
ddof=0 to Panda's standard
deviation function.

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,150
This argument controls
whether the corrected or

55
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,190
the uncorrected standard
deviation is taken.

56
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,610
If you don't know what
the difference is,

57
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,950
there's more information on the page
linked in the instructor notes.

58
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,420
Many times when you're standardizing
variables, it doesnt matter too much

59
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,020
whether you take the corrected or
uncorrected standard deviation.

60
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,680
But to calculate Pearson's r
specifically, it's important to take

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,159
the uncorrected standard deviation,
which you can do using ddof=0.
