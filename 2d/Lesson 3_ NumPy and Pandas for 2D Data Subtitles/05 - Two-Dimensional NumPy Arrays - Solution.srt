1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,880
First, I'm going to write code that will
work on this small example array, so

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,510
that I can see whether it's
working at every step.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,620
Then when I'm finished, I'll turn it
into this function, mean riders for

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,090
max station.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,180
The first step is to find the station
with the maximum riders on

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,520
the first day.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,140
The first day is row 0 of the array,
which I can get by passing 0 as the row

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,680
position, and colon, meaning all of
the columns, as the column position.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,650
And I"ll check that that worked and
sure enough, the first row was printed.

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,980
Now to find the maximum value,
I would find the .max function.

11
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,000
What I actually need is the station
that had the maximum value.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,690
To get that,
I'll use the arg max function,

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,760
which will return the position
of the maximum value.

14
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,570
Taking a a look,
I can see it was position 3.

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,220
And sure enough, column 3 in
the array has the maximum value.

16
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,840
I'll name this value max_station.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,640
Next I want to find the mean
riders per day for that station.

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,430
First I want to get the ridership
data for that station, so

19
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,010
I'll select all rows, and
the max_station column.

20
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,430
And I'll take a look, and sure enough,

21
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,360
that gives the correct column
of the ridership data.

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,440
Next I'll take the mean of those values.

23
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,090
And I'll call it mean_for_max, meaning
the mean value for the max station.

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,650
Finally, I need to find
the overall mean for comparison.

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,990
I can do that by simply
taking ridership.mean.

26
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,850
Now I'm ready to move this
code inside of my function.

27
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,560
Since the example array and the argument
to the function have the same name,

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,320
ridership, I don't need
to rename anything.

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,660
And I'll return both values.

30
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,830
Next I'll call this function
on the example array.

31
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,730
It looks like the overall mean
was about 2300 and the mean for

32
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,190
the max station was about 3200.

33
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,530
So the station with the higher
ridership on the first day

34
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,050
also had a higher ridership
overall than the average.

35
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,110
Of course, that doesn't mean it has
the maximum overall ridership out of

36
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:54,130
any station, but you'll calculate
that in the next exercise.
