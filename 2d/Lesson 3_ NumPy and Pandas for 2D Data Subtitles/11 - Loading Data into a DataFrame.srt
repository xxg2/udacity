00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,150
A data frame is a particularly good data
structure to represent the contents of

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,738
a CSV file.

3
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,360
It's a two-dimensional data
structure with a different type for

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,160
each column, which is often
exactly what you want for a CSV.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,920
Pandas has a function called read_csv,

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,910
which takes in the file name of a CSV
file and loads it into a data frame.

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,690
I'll use this to load in the New York
subway and weather data.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,860
Since there is a lot of data I don't
want to print out the entire data frame

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,220
like I've done before.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,630
Instead, I'll use the head function to
print out just the first five lines.

11
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,190
The head function returns
a smaller data frame so

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,350
the results display just
like a small data frame.

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,420
I can also use the describe function to
see some statistics about each column

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,130
like the mean and
the standard deviation.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,960
You got a preview of the read CSB
function at the end of the last lesson.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,590
It was used by the starter code
that loaded in the gap minder

17
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,470
dataset for you.
