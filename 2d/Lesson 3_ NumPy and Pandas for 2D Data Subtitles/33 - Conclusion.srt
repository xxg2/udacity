00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,890
Congratulations, you've
finished the course.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:03,710
Hopefully, you've made some

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,640
interesting discoveries about
the New York subway data.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,286
At this point,

5
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:10,376
you know how to go through the data
analysis process from start to finish.

6
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:14,677
And you can use NumPy's and Pandas to
write data analysis code that's clean,

7
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,970
concise, and runs quickly.

8
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,280
Great job.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,970
I hope you've enjoyed taking this course
as much as I enjoyed creating it.

10
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:23,530
I want to hear your thoughts.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,980
Please write a forum post sharing what
were your favorite parts of the course

12
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,507
and what suggestions do you have for
how to improve it.

13
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:31,010
And by the way for

14
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,120
some extra fun check out the pandas
links in the instructor notes.
